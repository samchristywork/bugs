I was having dinner with someone (who shall remain nameless), when the concept
of software bugs came up. They declared that bugs in published software were
rare to the point that we shouldn't worry about them. This person claimed to
have never seen a bug in production software in their life.

I literally spit out my drink when I heard this.

I believe that this outrageous statement can be attributed to a kind of
selective memory that users have when interfacing with software. Users don't
remember the bugs that they encounter, or do not have the technical expertise to
identify them when they come up.

I believe that bugs are prevalent in all kinds of software, from small programs
like the kind I develop on this account, to large programs used by millions and
produced by teams of highly capable engineers. In order to prove this, I will be
writing down bugs as I encounter them for a few months, and adding them to the
table below:

| Date | Product | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-09-01 | Amazon.com | Got a "Secure Connection Failed" when trying to access the site. Reloading the page fixed the issue. |
| 2022-09-01 | Npcap 1.60 | I was installing this software on my work computer and the installer would not continue beyond "Starting the npcap driver". I waited about 20 minutes. As the installer could not be closed, I had to restart my computer. |
| 2022-09-01 | GrubSouth | I got two duplicate notifications. Both offered the same promo code, and had the same text. |
| 2022-09-01 | Windows | The "Troubleshoot sound problems" button doesn't work. Clicking on it reveals a message that says: "You'll need a new app to open this ms-conotact-support-link". |
| 2022-09-01 | Jabra Headphones | I can't get audio through the headphones provided by my work. |
| 2022-09-01 | WSL | Could not enable WSL, restarting the computer fixed the issue. |
| 2022-08-30 | PathGroup | An image on "pathgroup.com" failed to load. |
| 2022-08-29 | Workday | Changes to my tax information and marital status did not update. |
| 2022-08-29 | Windows | Current system time is incorrect despite having a network connection and access to NTP. |
| 2022-08-29 | Amazon Prime | The subtitles for the movie "Start Trek IV: The Voyage Home" were offset by about ten seconds. Switching the subtitles from "English (US)" to "English" resolved the issue. |
| 2022-08-27 | Reddit.com | Reddit CDN was down for me. |
| 2022-08-27 | Firefox | A tab that was playing something on Amazon Video crashed. |
| 2022-08-26 | Lego Pick a Brick | When I updated my search criteria, the page number did not reset to one, so that it said something like page "6 of 1". Because the page was beyond the end of the search results, the list of results was empty. |
| 2022-08-26 | Google Chrome | When I resized my window, none of the tabs reflowed. They remained squished together as if the window was the size it was before I resized it. |
| 2022-08-23 | YouTube Video | I saw about five frames of visual distortion in a YouTube video I was watching. It was a combination of color distortion, a kind of picture-in-picture affect, and some horizontal banding. |
| 2022-08-23 | eScreen123 | The Forensic Drug Testing Custody and Control form I got at the end of my visit to Quest Diagnostics has overlapping text. The document has markings indicating it was automatically generated by "eScreen123". |
| 2022-08-23 | GMail | There were multiple "show context" buttons in an email chain that I was a part of. <a href=./res/gmail.png>[Image]</a> |
| 2022-08-22 | Target Self Service | My receipt got stuck in the printer and I had to dig my fingers in to extract it. Not really a software bug. |
| 2022-08-22 | Text Messages | I have gotten text messages from several family members regarding their results in the game "Wordle". I assume they are supposed to represent a game board, but they don't render correctly on my phone and show up as grey boxes and missing characters. |
| 2022-08-21 | GMail | I tried to access my GMail account through my web browser, but all I got was a white page. Reloading the page with `ctrl-r` did not work. Reloading with `ctrl-shift-r` fixed the issue. |
| 2022-08-21 | Android | My phone screen lit up for no reason. It usually does this when I get a text, it reaches 100% battery power, or when I press the power button, but in this case there was no such stimulus. |
| 2022-08-19 | Minecraft | My girlfriend fell into lava and died in Minecraft, and when she re-spawned, her character still appeared to be on fire. She did not take any damage, and water did not put the fire out. Logging out of the server and re-joining fixed the issue. |
| 2022-08-19 | Confluence/PDF | Completely broken formatting when trying to preview a PDF. Overlapping characters, placeholder images instead of the images that are supposed to be in the document, and misaligned text. |
| 2022-08-18 | Github.com | Could not hover over any of the boxes in the contribution tracker to find out how many contributions I made that day. The tooltip simply did not spawn. Refreshing the page fixed the issue. |
| 2022-08-18 | Deltek Time and Expense | When entering a contract name/number, it is useful to press the "Query" button to list out the possible values you can enter. In the "new and improved" version of this software, the button doesn't always appear. This can be remedied by pressing "Cancel" and re-trying the operation. |
| 2022-08-18 | TCL TV | The TV disconnected from the Wi-Fi despite no other devices exhibiting this behavior, and no credential changes. |
| 2022-08-17 | Internet | I had no internet at work for a few hours. |
| 2022-08-16 | Github.com | The label displaying the year in "Contribution activity" was cut off, and the text was partly obscured. I think this is due to a resize issue because I previously had the window half screen, and resized it to full. The issue went away on refresh. |
| 2022-08-16 | Microsoft Windows | I wasn't able to log into my computer at work using my security card. The computer was stuck on the "Welcome" screen for 10+ minutes. |
| 2022-08-15 | Microsoft Windows | I wasn't able to type the name of the program I wanted to open into the search bar. Typing any character would just close the start menu. Waiting a few minutes fixed the issue. |
| 2022-08-14 | Dell Laptop | When a 65 Watt charger is plugged in, the error message "Alert! A 65W AC Power adaptor has been detected. The System can only boot with a 240W Power adaptor or greater". Ignoring the strange capitalization and lack of a period at the end, this statement turns out to be false: the system can boot just fine if you unplug the charger. |
| 2022-08-14 | Github.com | The contribution tracker sometimes shows a box dated one day in the future. Refreshing the page fixes the issue. |
| 2022-08-14 | Heartlandrentals.com | The accessibility icon in the mobile version of the site obscures the price of the rental property. Switching the phone to landscape mode fixes the issue. There is no other easy way to check the price. |
| 2022-08-13 | Prime Technical Services Background Check | Website indicates that I have to close a tab to continue, but no such tab is open. |
| 2022-08-13 | Elden Ring | Crash in Liurnia. |
| 2022-08-13 | Elden Ring | Crash when I was in Volcano manner. |
| 2022-08-13 | Google Takeout | When I tried to download my exported Gmail data, I got sent to a "403" Error page. The problem eventually resolved itself. |
| 2022-08-12 | Amazon.com | Amazon Video would not load. Only the header and footer of the page loaded. |
